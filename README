# multiple_lambdas_optimization

This repository contains code for optimizing multiple lambda values across various scenarios, focusing on applications such as data assimilation, expert routing, and large-scale optimization problems. The project provides Python test scripts that evaluate different optimization strategies and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with multi-source inputs. The goal is to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in environmental, logistics, and related optimization tasks.

## Key Features:
- **Data Assimilation**: Includes scripts to test and implement data assimilation techniques.
- **Expert Routing**: Implements optimization solutions for routing problems with expert systems.
- **Large-Scale Optimization**: Scalable approaches to tackle complex optimization tasks involving multiple sources.
- **PDE Solvers**: Validates and tests multi-source PDE solvers for optimal solutions.

## Recent Updates:
- Files have been reorganized for better structure and maintainability.
- Improved support for handling large-scale multi-source optimization scenarios.

## Installation & Usage:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ppokhrel1/multiple_lambdas_optimization.git
