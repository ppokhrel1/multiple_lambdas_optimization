# Generalized Multi-source Assimilation: A Framework for Cross-Modal Integration and Source Optimization

**Authors**: Pujan Pokhrel, Austin Schmidt, Elias Ioup, Mahdi Abdelguerfi

This repository contains code for optimizing multiple lambda values across various scenarios, focusing on applications such as data assimilation, expert routing, and large-scale optimization problems. The goal is to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in environmental, logistics, and related scientific tasks.

We propose a flexible and scalable architecture that performs:

- **Multi-source data assimilation**
- **Cross-modal optimization of lambda hyperparameters**
- **Physics-informed modeling using PDE solvers**
- **Expert system integration via Lagrangian-based routing**

## 🔍 Overview

Our framework is designed for large-scale scientific and logistical applications where combining information from heterogeneous modalities (e.g., sensor networks, numerical models, expert systems) is critical to accuracy and decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Modules

- `data_assimilation_test.py`: Implements and benchmarks data assimilation strategies for source fusion.
- `expert_routing_test.py`: Uses Lagrangian losses to improve expert-based path optimization.
- `large_scale_multi_source_test.py`: Evaluates multi-source integration in large-scale optimization settings.
- `multi_source_pde_solver_test.py`: Tests PDE solvers using cross-modal lambda tuning.
- `testing_data_assimilation.py`: Includes experiments on visual tuning, output formatting, and DA diagnostics.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Multi-Modal Lambda Optimization**: Automatically tunes weighting parameters across sources.
- ✅ **Lagrangian Loss Integration**: Enforces physics consistency via trajectory-informed loss functions.
- ✅ **Plug-and-Play Architecture**: Drop-in ready components for new data sources or simulation tasks.
- ✅ **Scalability**: Efficient for both small-scale tests and large-scale simulations on HPC or cloud systems.
